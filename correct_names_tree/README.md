# Purpose

Due to an error on the genomic data pipeline, the names of the samples were systematically altered.
This is just script to fix the names of the original files.

If everything is fine with your files, just ignore this. If you find this useful for you, just switch the names on 
the excel files to contain the original and the final names that you wanted on the samples you want to change
