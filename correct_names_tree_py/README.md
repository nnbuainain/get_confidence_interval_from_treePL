# Purpose

Due to an error during the genomic data processing pipeline, the names of the samples were systematically altered.
This is just script to fix the names of the original files.

If everything is fine with your files, just ignore this. If you find this useful for you, just replace the names on 
the excel files to contain the original and the final names that you want on the samples to be changed
